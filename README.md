Too allow us view the diferents files that conform the web-page and view the diferents reports how errors reports, tokens errors, AST reports, etc. 

Characteristics:
  - Open files (web pages.)  
  - Multiple view using multitab.   
  - Output console.  
  - Responsing size of page. 
  - Reports of symbol table (Report until the last breakpoint setting)  


## Characteristics of lenguage of the three lengauges. 
To see the specific of desing of lenguage see the carpet enunciado. 
  - Analysis and execution complete of lenguage of programations javascript, chtml and css.  
  - Support of class and all characteristics of POO.  
  - Lexical, syntactic and semantics analisys complete. 
  - Report of errors. 
  - Report of symbol table by graphics using graphviz. 
  - Report of AST generated. 
  - AST generated using the pattern of desing interpeter. 
  - Using singlenton pattern. 
  - Develped using Jflex and CUP.
